# chainblock

[chainblock](https://chainblock.art) is an open source hardware project for displaying NFT art. The project consists of a Raspberry Pi image and a dapp.

The Pi image is based off of [jareware/chilipie-kiosk](https://github.com/jareware/chilipie-kiosk). The image launches chromium in kiosk mode and opens [https://chainblock.art](https://chainblock.art), which serves the NextJS app in this repo.
